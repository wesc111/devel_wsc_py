# Installed python version and packages
I have installed python version 3.14 with addition of following packages
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- jupyter lab
- jupyter notebook

Install directories are added to the $PATH variable.
- C:\Program Files\Python
- C:\Program Files\Python\Scripts
- C:\users\werne\appdata\roaming\python\python314\Scripts
- C:\users\werne\appdata\roaming\python\python314\site-packages

The git repository, where my python examples are available, is 
- https://github.com/wesc111/devel_wsc_py

Previously, the python examples were located inside
- C:\Users\werne\OneDrive\devel_werner_2025\python

Basically, jupyter always takes the path at which it was started as root, so you can start it with a sequence of 
```
cd C:\Users\werne\OneDrive\devel_werner_2025\python
jupyter lab
```
That opens a notebook
